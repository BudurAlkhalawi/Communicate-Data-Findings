## Dataset

> I choosed Flight delays dataset from RITA website which contained information on flight delays and reasonses. The link of download dataset is,
http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html


## Summary of Findings

> During the exploration I found that The most frequent delay is one hour for departure and arrival, I took a sample 1 million from the data and found that the difference between canceled and non-canceled flights is very large, and the number of canceled is small, also from the distribution that the relationship is stronger between zero and 3000 miles for Distance with the arrival time from zero to 500 minutes in both 2007 and 2008 year, The distribution for each of the reasons for the abolition takes a different form, From plot, I conclude that the lowest reasons for cancellation are security(D), And the least times that a cancellation occurred due to (NAS) was in November and at the destination DEN, And the least times that a cancellation occurred due to (weather) was in October and at the destination LAS,  I also see that most of the flights diverted have larger Distance than the non-diverted


## Key Insights for Presentation

> Dataset contains information on United State flight delay. This project shows how delay changes with time and location and how many delays each reason cause.
